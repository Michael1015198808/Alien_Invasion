Introduction

This is a classic game named Alien Invasion in Python3.
It's based on Chapter XII ~ XIV in book
Python Crash Course A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming
by Eric Matthes.
Thanks for such an wonderful book!
And I build this repository just to practice using Git.


Notes

Run alien_invasion.py or run.bat to play the game.
Remember you've download pygame package.
Since I use PyCharm to write this game( I strongly recommend this IDE! It's beyond words!), you may find some strange folders, just ignore!
update.bat is used to make commitment easier, DON'T RUN IT!( It's open sourse)
Any advices or bugs PLZ contact me, imformation listed below.
