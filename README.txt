Introduction

This is a classic game named Alien Invasion in Python3.
It's based on Chapter XII ~ XIV in book
Python Crash Course A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming
by Eric Matthes.
Thanks for such an wonderful book!
And I build this repository just to practice using Git.


Notes

Run alien_invasion.py or run.bat to play the game.
Remember you've download pygame package.
Since I use PyCharm to write this game( I strongly recommend this IDE! It's beyond words!), you may find some strange folders, just ignore!
